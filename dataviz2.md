# Part 2: Visualization created using Flourish
This data visualization was created using the public data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). I downloaded their dataset and used it to create this following visualization on Flourish. The debt-to-GDP ratio is displayed by the maroon line in this grid of line charts, and each chart represents an individual country from the original dataset.
