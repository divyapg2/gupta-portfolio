# Final Project

## Part I ##

**Outline** 

Summary

The recent increase in mental health issues indicates a demand for mental health services.
People can seek help by going to a psychotherapist or counselor

Major elements: 
1. display increase of mental health issues (anxiety and depression) in US adults (2019 compared to 2020)
  2. can't just brush this off after the pandemic (maybe show implications of not seeking help)
3. show utilization of mental health services (last 4 weeks dataset) and emphasize the increase or percentage for therapy appointments vs not going to therapy
4. show teletherapy services offered by therapists/mental health specialists and the number of people who use teletherapy
5. talk about how many people do not know about the services covered by insurance; also show the statistics on people who thought they could handle problems w/o treatment
   or who didn't know where to go for services
6. provide resources/tips for people to make an appointment
7. display patient journey map of steps where person seeks therapy and then goes through the process of finding a therapist and going to appointments
8. call to action: encourage people to seek help by finding a few therapists in their area and making an appointment or asking their PCP for a referral

**Data**
First, I plan on presenting data about the increase of mental health issues in the past year in US adults. I will most likely focus on anxiety and depression. 
Then, I will transition to talking about "mental health care in the last 4 weeks" and display the most recent time period of data. This will emphasize how many people went to therapy appointments, took medications, or both, and how many people did not do those things even though they were supposed to. After that, I will talk about the number of adults who have received mental health treatment and services and the increase in the uptake of those services since 2002. There will be a distinction in the increase and it will serve as a way to normalize seeking treatment or counseling. This will lead me to talk about the reasons why people do not receive mental health treatment. I will highlight a couple of statistics here about that including some such as handling the issues without help and not knowing where to seek it in the first place. 

I know that accessibility, affordability, and insurance coverage are all relevant issues, but my presentation will not be diving into all of that here. Instead, I will highlight the different insured/uninsured people who receive services. This will show that people may not know about the coverage their insurance provides, and that if they have access to it or even if they do not, they might have a good reason to look into it (especially if they are seeking help or feeling mental distress right now). There are sliding fee scales that therapists now offer to people paying out of pocket. This may be useful to an audience member who does not have coverage for psychotherapy. I will also talk about the increase in teletherapy. It is a convenient, low effort method for people to receive therapy or counseling. It is also very useful during the pandemic where social distancing is essential. I think I may talk about the benefits of receiving therapy or counseling here, too. My goal is to normalize therapy and seeking help and these visualizations will hopefully allow for that. My call to action is that people use the resources I provide and feel a little bit more comfortable making a first consultation or continuing therapy after my presentation.

**Method and Media**
I plan on using Excel to extract some of the main data elements within the datasets I'm using. I will then use Tableau and/or Flourish to create the data visualizations that will make the most impact on my story. 

I will complete my final project by using Shorthand. My goal is to create a compelling story about mental health and seeking therapy. I will first show the recent increase in mental health disorders and some of the data on how many people have sought help recently. Displaying the increase in teletherapy services will also be a visual I use. That way, an audience member will feel less alone so that they can seek help from a licensed psychotherapist or counselor.
