# Final Project

## Part I ##

**Outline** 
Summary
The recent increase in mental health issues indicates a demand for mental health services.
People can seek help by going to a psychotherapist or counselor

Major elements: 
1. display increase of mental health issues (anxiety and depression) in US adults (2019 compared to 2020)
  2. can't just brush this off after the pandemic (maybe show implications of not seeking help)
3. show utilization of mental health services (last 4 weeks dataset) and emphasize the increase or percentage for therapy appointments vs not going to therapy
4. show teletherapy services offered by therapists/mental health specialists and the number of people who use teletherapy
5. talk about how many people do not know about the services covered by insurance; also show the statistics on people who thought they could handle problems w/o treatment
   or who didn't know where to go for services
6. provide resources/tips for people to make an appointment
7. display patient journey map of steps where person seeks therapy and then goes through the process of finding a therapist and going to appointments
8. call to action: encourage people to seek help by finding a few therapists in their area and making an appointment or asking their PCP for a referral
