# Final Project

## Part I ##

**Outline** 

Summary

The recent increase in mental health issues indicates a demand for mental health services.
People can seek help by going to a psychotherapist or counselor

Major elements: 
1. display increase of mental health issues (anxiety and depression) in US adults (2019 compared to 2020)
  2. can't just brush this off after the pandemic (maybe show implications of not seeking help)
3. show utilization of mental health services (last 4 weeks dataset) and emphasize the increase or percentage for therapy appointments vs not going to therapy
4. show teletherapy services offered by therapists/mental health specialists and the number of people who use teletherapy
5. talk about how many people do not know about the services covered by insurance; also show the statistics on people who thought they could handle problems w/o treatment
   or who didn't know where to go for services
6. provide resources/tips for people to make an appointment
7. display patient journey map of steps where person seeks therapy and then goes through the process of finding a therapist and going to appointments
8. call to action: encourage people to seek help by finding a few therapists in their area and making an appointment or asking their PCP for a referral

**Data**
First, I plan on presenting data about the increase of mental health issues in the past year in US adults. I will most likely focus on anxiety and depression. 
Then, I will transition to talking about "mental health care in the last 4 weeks" and display the most recent time period of data. This will emphasize how many people went to therapy appointments, took medications, or both, and how many people did not do those things even though they were supposed to. After that, I will talk about the number of adults who have received mental health treatment and services and the increase in the uptake of those services since 2018. There will be a distinction in the increase and it will serve as a way to normalize seeking treatment or counseling. This will lead me to talk about the reasons why people do not receive mental health treatment. I will highlight a couple of statistics here about that including some such as handling the issues without help and not knowing where to seek it in the first place. 

I know that accessibility, affordability, and insurance coverage are all relevant issues, but my presentation will not be diving into all of that here. Instead, I will highlight the different insured/uninsured people who receive services. This will show that people may not know about the coverage their insurance provides, and that if they have access to it or even if they do not, they might have a good reason to look into it (especially if they are seeking help or feeling mental distress right now). There are sliding fee scales that therapists now offer to people paying out of pocket. This may be useful to an audience member who does not have coverage for psychotherapy. I will also talk about the increase in teletherapy. It is a convenient, low effort method for people to receive therapy or counseling. It is also very useful during the pandemic where social distancing is essential. I think I may talk about the benefits of receiving therapy or counseling here, too. My goal is to normalize therapy and seeking help and these visualizations will hopefully allow for that. My call to action is that people use the resources I provide and feel a little bit more comfortable making a first consultation or continuing therapy after my presentation.

**Method and Media**

I plan on using Excel to extract some of the main data elements within the datasets I'm using. I will then use Tableau and/or Flourish to create the data visualizations that will make the most impact on my story. I will first show the recent increase in mental health disorders and some of the data on how many people have sought help recently. Displaying the increase in teletherapy services will also be a visual I use. 

I will complete my final project by using Shorthand. My goal is to create a compelling story about mental health and seeking therapy. That way, an audience member will feel less alone, and then they will know they can seek help from a licensed psychotherapist or counselor.

**User research and Interviews**

Target audience: US adults in general, those thinking about seeking mental health services

Finding representative individuals to interview: asked graduate students, young working professionals, and a middle-aged woman

Interview script:
1. What is the first thing you noticed?
2. Can you make sense of each visualization?
3. Are you able to understand the storyboard overall and what did you take away as the main idea?
4. What questions came to mind as you looked at the storyboard?
5. Is any part of the storyboard confusing to you?
6. What would you change about the storyboard?

Interview 1:
1. I noticed the picture of the hands reaching out to each other. I think that's very effective and relatable in terms of reaching out help for mental health. It really drives the main point of your storyboard.
2. For the pie charts, the gray and lighter gray colors make it confusing and not visually appealing in a way that I would remember the data visualizations. 
3. Yes, I understood the storyboard overall, and what I took as the main idea was that there are many mental health care options available, and it is normal to reach out). Essentially, the story wants to eradicate the stigma and shame of reaching out for mental help. 
4. I was a little confused on the teletherapy data visualization. Did you mean to compare how teletherapy usage increased for psychiatrists and psychotherapists? Because your key icons placements are off. 
5. Some data visualizations were confusing especially with lack of axis labels on the first, third, fourth, and fifth data visualizations. 
6. Maybe at the end you could provide options for mental health care through employer-based health insurance, etc. Give examples of where they can access mental health care. If I was the audience, at the end, starting my search without any guides would be a little intimidating because I would not know exactly where to start. Overall, I thought your story flowed well!

Interview 2: 
1. The number of people using mental health services has increased and it's okay to ask for help
2. I understood most of the visuals except the Storyline. I am not sure what the lighter line is supposed to represent and it's distracting because it seems like it's not really adding anything to the story.
3. I think I understand the storyboard and the main idea I took away is that mental health services are 'easier' to come by but a good number of people still don't know how to access these services.
4. I wondered why the pandemic made it so that more people are asking for help? Do they have more time to attend appointments because of remote work? Or is it the rise of telehealth services? Or loneliness? Or unemployment? 
5. The storyline graphic was the most confusing part for me. Oh yes, the first slide is a little confusing when I look at it again "recent increase in mental health indicates...' Is it mental health seeking behaviour? The graphic from 2020 with the heading 'use of mental health services in the last 4 weeks' is rather confusing because do you mean now or 2020?
6. I would change the graphs; I imagine because it's a storyboard that's why the colours look like sticky notes? I would change them to be the actual olour instead of grey with the sticky notes colour thing.


Interview 3: 
1. The background picture on slide 1 with the hands reaching out to each other which connected to the topic
2. Yes, each visualization has enough information to stand alone on its own and make sense. I really liked how impactful the reasons for not seeking help visualizations were.
3. The storyline flowed well and I liked the progression from stating the mental health issues, use of services, increase in teletherapy, and how people are reaching out for help more now. The main idea seems to be that mental health issues have increased during the pandemic but people have also been increasingly reaching out for mental services. 
4. I didn't really have many questions. While going through the storyboard, the question that I would have had next was answered with the next visualization so you walked the audience through the story by answering the questions. 
5. For the teletherapy visualization, you used pink and blue again to keep the color scheme consistent but I thought initially that it still stood for May 2020 and Jan 2021 based on the previous visualization so that was a little confusing. 
6. Maybe just the color scheme of that teletherapy visualization but otherwise the storyline flowed well

Interview 4:
1. first thing i noticed was the title screen! 
2. yes, each visualization makes sense and it is clear what data each one is depicting
3. yes, the storyboard makes sense overall. the beginning presents the idea that the pandemic has brought on increases in mental health issues, and the visuals that follow show various trends that relate to the increases in mental health issues like changes in accessing mental health services, changes in mental health providers who are using teletherapy, etc.
4. I wondered if there is any data related to changes in stigma or changes in how much seeking therapy has become normalized over the course of the pandemic
5. no part of the storyboard is confusing!
6. I would change the title on the title screen to "Recent increase in mental health issues indicates that seeking services is a normal option". I would also change the title of the visual "Use of mental health services in the last 4 weeks" to "Use of mental health services over the pandemic" to show how access has changed more broadly.

Interview 5:
1. Increase in the mental health issues.
2. Very clear visualisation
3. Understood the storyboard and main idea is people should seek help for mental health issues.
4. Impact of  Social distancing during COVID -19 pandemic people are not able to socialise and it is increasing the mental health issues.
5. No confusion
6. Increase in substance use during pandemic as a way to cope up with mental health issues.

Visualization changes to address the issues identified:
- having a consistent and clear color theme (teletherapy section)
- won't be using gray 
- include axis labels on graphs
- show more explicit information about normalization of seeking help
- provide a visualization/examples of how people can seek help through employer-sponsored insurance, self-insurance, etc.
- teletherapy visualization - need to make sure the colors represent the time period not the specialists (each set of bar chart represents a different specialist), show the actual number for the percentage
- for statistics use a stick figure or person icon to display 3/10 
- call to action slide - include the logo for APA or just the name "American Psych Assoc." after the quote
- for the 4 weeks data - rank the bars from lowest to highest use, use the data in a line graph to show change over months in use of mental health services
- increase in mental health issues graph - indicate when the pandemic started (can show with color), include actual percentage values
