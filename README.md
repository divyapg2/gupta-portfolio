This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hi there! My name is Divya (she/her), and I'm a Masters student in the Health Care Policy and Management program at CMU. Prior to graduate school, I lived in Philadelphia and worked for an electronic health records company as a revenue cycle account manager for two years. I dealt with physician practices and realized that I had a desire to pivot towards healthcare policy, which led me to CMU. Since I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, CMU's campus is not unfamiliar to me and I'm happy to be back in Pittsburgh. 

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, and learning about wellness. I share some of these things on a personal visual blog on an app you may be familiar with--Instagram. I like to create uplififting and engaging content about anything related to self-improvement and wellness, graduate school, my style, food, and sometimes music. Right now my goal on there is just to share tips and motivation with people so they can feel inspired or feel less alone in their experiences. Other than that, I truly love music, so in my free time I like to sing, play piano, and dance. 

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn how to use data visualization tools so that I can depict healthcare/healthcare tech data so that it is easy to understand. I also would like to learn how to bring in human elements into visualizations so that people feel connected to it. Once I graduate from CMU, I plan on pursuing a career in healthcare policy analysis or development. Healthcare is overflowing with data so being able to simplify it and show what it all means will be imperative to the decision making process in the policy world.
