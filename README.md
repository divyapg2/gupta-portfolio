# About me
Hi there! My name is Divya (she/her), and I'm a Masters student in the Health Care Policy and Management program at CMU. In this course, I'm interested in learning how to use data visualization tools so that I can depict healthcare/healthcare tech data so that it is easy to understand. I also would like to learn how to bring in human elements into visualizations so that people feel connected to it. Once I graduate from CMU, I plan on pursuing a career in healthcare policy analysis or development.
