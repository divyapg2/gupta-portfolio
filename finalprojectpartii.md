## Final Project Part II ##

Wireframes and Storyboard: https://preview.shorthand.com/8dtjuMeaHWhDAHbX

**User research and Interviews**

Target audience: US adults in general, those thinking about seeking mental health services

Finding representative individuals to interview: asked graduate students, young working professionals, and a middle-aged woman

Interview script:
1. What is the first thing you noticed?
2. Can you make sense of each visualization?
3. Are you able to understand the storyboard overall and what did you take away as the main idea?
4. What questions came to mind as you looked at the storyboard?
5. Is any part of the storyboard confusing to you?
6. What would you change about the storyboard?

Interview 1:
1. I noticed the picture of the hands reaching out to each other. I think that's very effective and relatable in terms of reaching out help for mental health. It really drives the main point of your storyboard.
2. For the pie charts, the gray and lighter gray colors make it confusing and not visually appealing in a way that I would remember the data visualizations. 
3. Yes, I understood the storyboard overall, and what I took as the main idea was that there are many mental health care options available, and it is normal to reach out). Essentially, the story wants to eradicate the stigma and shame of reaching out for mental help. 
4. I was a little confused on the teletherapy data visualization. Did you mean to compare how teletherapy usage increased for psychiatrists and psychotherapists? Because your key icons placements are off. 
5. Some data visualizations were confusing especially with lack of axis labels on the first, third, fourth, and fifth data visualizations. 
6. Maybe at the end you could provide options for mental health care through employer-based health insurance, etc. Give examples of where they can access mental health care. If I was the audience, at the end, starting my search without any guides would be a little intimidating because I would not know exactly where to start. Overall, I thought your story flowed well!

Interview 2: 
1. The number of people using mental health services has increased and it's okay to ask for help
2. I understood most of the visuals except the Storyline. I am not sure what the lighter line is supposed to represent and it's distracting because it seems like it's not really adding anything to the story.
3. I think I understand the storyboard and the main idea I took away is that mental health services are 'easier' to come by but a good number of people still don't know how to access these services.
4. I wondered why the pandemic made it so that more people are asking for help? Do they have more time to attend appointments because of remote work? Or is it the rise of telehealth services? Or loneliness? Or unemployment? 
5. The storyline graphic was the most confusing part for me. Oh yes, the first slide is a little confusing when I look at it again "recent increase in mental health indicates...' Is it mental health seeking behaviour? The graphic from 2020 with the heading 'use of mental health services in the last 4 weeks' is rather confusing because do you mean now or 2020?
6. I would change the graphs; I imagine because it's a storyboard that's why the colours look like sticky notes? I would change them to be the actual olour instead of grey with the sticky notes colour thing.


Interview 3: 
1. The background picture on slide 1 with the hands reaching out to each other which connected to the topic
2. Yes, each visualization has enough information to stand alone on its own and make sense. I really liked how impactful the reasons for not seeking help visualizations were.
3. The storyline flowed well and I liked the progression from stating the mental health issues, use of services, increase in teletherapy, and how people are reaching out for help more now. The main idea seems to be that mental health issues have increased during the pandemic but people have also been increasingly reaching out for mental services. 
4. I didn't really have many questions. While going through the storyboard, the question that I would have had next was answered with the next visualization so you walked the audience through the story by answering the questions. 
5. For the teletherapy visualization, you used pink and blue again to keep the color scheme consistent but I thought initially that it still stood for May 2020 and Jan 2021 based on the previous visualization so that was a little confusing. 
6. Maybe just the color scheme of that teletherapy visualization but otherwise the storyline flowed well

Interview 4:
1. first thing I noticed was the title screen! 
2. yes, each visualization makes sense and it is clear what data each one is depicting
3. yes, the storyboard makes sense overall. The beginning presents the idea that the pandemic has brought on increases in mental health issues, and the visuals that follow show various trends that relate to the increases in mental health issues like changes in accessing mental health services, changes in mental health providers who are using teletherapy, etc.
4. I wondered if there is any data related to changes in stigma or changes in how much seeking therapy has become normalized over the course of the pandemic
5. no part of the storyboard is confusing!
6. I would change the title on the title screen to "Recent increase in mental health issues indicates that seeking services is a normal option". I would also change the title of the visual "Use of mental health services in the last 4 weeks" to "Use of mental health services over the pandemic" to show how access has changed more broadly.

Interview 5:
1. Increase in the mental health issues.
2. Very clear visualisation
3. Understood the storyboard and main idea is people should seek help for mental health issues.
4. Impact of  Social distancing during COVID -19 pandemic people are not able to socialise and it is increasing the mental health issues.
5. No confusion
6. Increase in substance use during pandemic as a way to cope up with mental health issues.

Visualization changes to address the issues identified:
- having a consistent and clear color theme (teletherapy section)
- won't be using gray 
- include axis labels on graphs
- show more explicit information about normalization of seeking help
- provide a visualization/examples of how people can seek help through employer-sponsored insurance, self-insurance, etc.
- teletherapy visualization - need to make sure the colors represent the time period not the specialists (each set of bar chart represents a different specialist), show the actual number for the percentage
- for statistics use a stick figure or person icon to display 3/10 
- call to action slide - include the logo for APA or just the name "American Psych Assoc." after the quote
- for the 4 weeks data - rank the bars from lowest to highest use, use the data in a line graph to show change over months in use of mental health services
- increase in mental health issues graph - indicate when the pandemic started (can show with color), include actual percentage values
