## Data Visualizations: Critique by Design

## Original data visualization

I selected this visualization because it is about women's leadership, which is a topic that I'm concerned about. I think it is important for women to have equal treatment in the workplace. They should also be in leadership roles, and this data visualization shows the rating of how receptive different countries are to women leadership in different career sectors. It's very intriguing to me that a majority of the G7 countries have a high index rating for wanting women leadership in most of their sectors. 

## My process

My process in approaching this data visualization was pretty straightfoward. First, I made some observations about what I liked and didn't like about the visual and whether it was informative. This is a very important topic and all the numbers being included in the visual are certainly important, but as I looked at the visual I noticed some things I wanted to change right away, which led me to choosing it for this assignment. As I was using the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile as a method to critique this visual, I noticed that there were reasons for my confusion. I was able to document those clearly with this method and I could also broadly address certain things I was confused about. In comparison, the Good Charts method is one that requires more specifications for what is going on in the visualization. I do think the Good Charts method allows me to think about the specific parts of the visual, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's better. I think it depends on how rigid the creator of the visualization is with the chart they are creating. 

As I considered redesign, I moved to wireframes which allowed me to sketch my versions of the visualization. I used different colors, a different title, and a key as those were what stood out to me most in terms of clarifying the visual's purpose and main idea. The colors I chose at first were based off of the entire original report's colors and they were related to how I felt the overall audience would perceive the data. The second visualization I created included colors that I thought would be perceived as good and bad--for me, these cleared up the confusion from the original colors. I did consider creating a hierarchical heat map, but since there were so many numbers, I decided to use a simple Excel spreadsheet to create the visual instead later.

# Wireframes

The feedback I received from a couple of friends:

Feedback 1)
- Are the numbers in the key the number of women in leadership positions?
- I like the colors in the first wireframe
- I prefer the pink visual over the second
- I imagine the audience is women looking to lead in male-dominated industries

Feedback 2)
- I believe the audience is the general public
- I would define the key more clearly
- I think you're comparing women in different sectors in G7 countries

Feedback 3)
- The pink chart tells you how women leadership differs according to these various sectors in each country represented in the chart. It also tells you how countries compare to each other in how much women leadership may be prevalent. I think the higher index rating means there is more women leadership in that sector/country, but I'm not 100% sure
-  Intended audience could be people who are looking at gender leadership representation in certain industries, people who are trying to determine where to fund resources to advocate for women leadership in these sectors
- I am confused by the first chart because i am not sure what the higher/lower index scores mean for each industry (this may just be me not being familiar with index ratings) (i.e. media/entertainment has ratings that are half 70-80 and half 50-70, but I'm not sure what that tells me for that industry in particular)

With this feedback, I decided to redesign the visualization in Excel. To simplify the visual and avoid audience confusion, I left out all the numbers and just created a key with shades of magenta for each index rating range. I used the same title I created in the wireframe, and since the first wireframe seemed to be a crowdpleaser I chose that one. It also made the most sense to me given the context of the data because the rest of the original report used dark magenta as a positive color to indicate women leadership. I used that same color to refer to the high index ratings for women leadership in my final visualization. Also, I didn't feel the need to define the index ratings, as that is provided throughout the original data report, but I did include that the scale was 0-100 in the key. 


## My final data visualization
