# Final Project Part III #

### The Evolution of the Project ###

I made a few changes to the final project since the completion of Part II. For my final data story, I identified my audience as U.S. adults who are on the edge of seeking mental health services for anxiety and/or depression. My interviews gave me the validation I needed about the direction I was going with in my story. This story was only meant to be the initial push and step for people to start seeking mental health services, I did not analyze concerns about insurance in-depth. The focus of this story was to make people feel less alone so taht they can seek help. I provided resources for audience to simply click on and begin their search for a psychologist or psychotherapist so they could begin their search at the end of my story presentation.
