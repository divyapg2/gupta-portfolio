# Final Project Part III #

### The Evolution of the Project ###

I made a few changes to the final project since the completion of Part II. For my final data story, I identified my audience as U.S. adults who are on the edge of seeking mental health services for anxiety and/or depression. My interviews gave me the validation I needed about the direction I was going with in my story. I completely eliminated the storyline visual I created initially. That was more of an agenda I was going to do, but I couldn't decide on the shape to keep and wasn't really relevant to the actual data that would be depicted on Shorthand so I used the Story Header feature on Shorthand as a timeline, instead. This story was only meant to be the initial push and step for people to start seeking mental health services, I did not analyze concerns about insurance in-depth. The focus of this story was to make people feel less alone so that they see it's normal to seek help if they need it. In part II, I thought providing insurance information would be useful, but it was taking away from my overall story and I decided to leave it out. Maybe as a part IV or extension of the project, I could delve deeper into the health insurance side of psychotherapy and mental health services. I was not able to find data on  teletherapy adoption during COVID-19, so that visualization did not end up making the final data story. I also left out substance use; this is a whole subject matter of its own in terms of mental health, but it would need to stand alone to really provide the whole story and it wasn't true to the target audience. Including the numbers about depressiona and anxiety screens was very relevant and I am glad I included that to tie my story pieces together in the middle.

As a design decision, I did choose to have a consistent and clear color theme. I stuck to mainly pink, blue, and purple shades. I also did not use grey as suggested in user feedback; I only used it to differientiate parts that I wanted muted. I made sure to include axis labels on graphs, as is best practice. I also showed more explicit information about normalization of seeking help. Additionally, I provided resources for audience to simply click on and begin their search for a psychologist or psychotherapist at the end of the data story. Using one or two data sets was really useful in showing different aspects of the mental health increase and mental health services increase. I did have to go into Excel and clean some of the data and organize it in a way that would allow me to use Flourish most effectively. That part problably took me the longest amount of time. Researching the topic itself and the support behind the data and figures I used was not very difficult as this issue is very prevalent; it just took me some time to read and compile it for the sake of the story I was trying to lay out.
